# Accessibility
If you're having trouble playing my game due to any sort of accessibility problem, please file an issue!

## Color Vision Impairments
I've tried my best to make the color configuration for 16 players playable for these forms of color vision impairment:
- Protanomaly/Protanopia
- Deuteranomaly/Deuteranopia
- Tritanomaly

If you have one of these and have difficulty distinguishing empire colors, _or_ you have a form of color vision
impairment not listed, please file an issue, and I'll add the setting!

## Control Scheme
There aren't many controls to this game, but also I have not studied making games accessible for those with motor
control impairments.
- Gameplay requires left- and right-clicking and moving the mouse.
- Panning the map requires moving the mouse while holding the middle mouse button.
- Zooming the map requires using the scroll wheel.
- There is no in-game configuration; all is done by editing a text file.

## Visual Impairments
Sadly, this game is not friendly for those who are hard-of-seeing.
I've put actions to mitigate this on my TODO list.
